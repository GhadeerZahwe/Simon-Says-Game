# Task Requirements

I was tasked with creating a web-based Simon Says game, a classic memory and pattern recognition game. The game will present a sequence of colors or shapes, and the player must replicate that sequence by clicking on the correct elements in the correct order. The game should progressively increase in difficulty by adding longer sequences. Utilize the DOM to dynamically update the game state and user interface.

# HOW IT WORKS

##### When the game starts, Simon (the computer) will generate and display a random sequence of colors or shapes.
##### Simon will then highlight each element in the sequence, one at a time.
##### The player must click on the elements in the same order that Simon displayed.
##### If the player clicks the correct element, the game continues with the next element in the sequence.
##### If the player makes a mistake, the game ends.
##### Note that you should replicate the same animation e.g : 
when the player clicks you need to have that grey animation on the box, when the level increases it shows on top of the boxes, when the player loses the game ends and the background will turn red.
##### Find the video demo and the files needed.

##### The deliverable is as usual, no need to touch the files just create a script.js file.

### Turned in before the deadline
